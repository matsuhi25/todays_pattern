TidalCycles performance code place where I write every day.

The sounds and videos of these codes are mainly uploaded to [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/hiroki_mtplc) .
I will upload a summary video to [Youtube](http://youtube.com/@hirokimtplc) about once a month. Sound quality is better here!

[Custom Samples](custom_samples/) recorded with hardware/software synthesizers will also be available.
